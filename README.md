# drumKitJS
This is the 2nd boss level exercise from the Udemy fullstack course with Dr. Angela Yu.
For this exercise, she explains "this", which I have used in my Quilmes blog but in fact, I wasn't 100% sure what this "this" actually works, even I read the typeof doc from MDN. 

I'm actually quite happy that I spent the afternoon doing this exercise because she explains Higher Order Function, Callback and Switch in JS. Not to forget, how we can play sound and that the keypress is now "keydown" if I wanna detect a user has pressed a certain key on the keyboard.

I don't think I got a very good understanding on Callback despite I have written most of the code for my Quilmes blog using Node.js. I also think that this would be a module that I would want to repeat a few more times.

After going through each step, this gave me a nice idea to have other fun interaction on a website!
